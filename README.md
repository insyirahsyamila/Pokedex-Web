Pokédex Web

## Overview
Pokédex is a simple React web application that enables users explore and search for Pokemon data. It organizes data from the PokéAPI and shows it in an appropriate style, including a list of Pokemon cards and comprehensive details about each Pokemon that is chosen.

## Features
>> Pokemon Card Display;
 View a grid of Pokemon cards, each showing the Pokemon's ID, image, and name.

>> Pagination;
 Navigate through different pages of Pokemon cards using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

>> Search Function;
 Use the search bar to filter Pokemon cards based on their first letter in their names.

>> Detailed Pokémon Information;
 Click on a Pokemon card to view detailed information, including the Pokemon's name, image, type, abilities, and base stats.

## Decorative Features
>> Login;
 The Login feature is a function for future authentication features and is intended just for visual representation. It does not include backend integration or user authentication.

>> Collections;
 There is currently no backend functionality for managing or displaying a user's Pokemon collection. The Collection link in the navigation bar is merely an aesthetically pleasing placeholder meant for future growth.
